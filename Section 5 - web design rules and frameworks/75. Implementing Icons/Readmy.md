Steps:

1) the first step if we want to use icons is to choose icon pack. We are going to use heroicons which are available - heroicons.com. We need to use SVG icons, because this format is able to scale to different resolutions. SVG is actually just code. It is only way to desctibe graphical elements. 

The most common use case to use (place) icons is feature box.
