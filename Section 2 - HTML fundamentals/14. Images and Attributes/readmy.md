Steps: 
1) image element is a special. it doesn't have any content so it doesn't have closing tag. so if wo don't place any content in img how html know what content to use in this element? in this case we use attributes. they are a pieces of data which we can use to describe elements. Now we need source  - src attribute. We cam add also alt attribut which means alternative text that described what image is about?
